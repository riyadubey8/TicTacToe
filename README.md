How to Play
Run the program.
The game board is a 3x3 grid with row and column indices.
Player X starts first.
On your turn:
Enter the row number (0–2)
Enter the column number (0–2)
The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

After a game ends, you'll be prompted to play again
